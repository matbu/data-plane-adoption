= Configuring a Ceph backend

If the original deployment uses a Ceph storage backend for any service
(e.g. Glance, Cinder, Nova, Manila), the same backend must be used in the
adopted deployment and CRs must be configured accordingly.

== Prerequisites

* The `OpenStackControlPlane` CR must already exist.

== Variables

Define the shell variables used in the steps below. The values are
just illustrative, use values that are correct for your environment:

----
CEPH_SSH="ssh -i ~/install_yamls/out/edpm/ansibleee-ssh-key-id_rsa root@192.168.122.100"
CEPH_KEY=$($CEPH_SSH "cat /etc/ceph/ceph.client.openstack.keyring | base64 -w 0")
CEPH_CONF=$($CEPH_SSH "cat /etc/ceph/ceph.conf | base64 -w 0")
----

== Modify capabilities of the "openstack" user to accommodate Manila

On TripleO environments, the CephFS driver in Manila is configured to use
its own keypair. For convenience, modify the `openstack` user so that you
can use it across all OpenStack services.

Using the same user across the services serves two purposes:

* The capabilities of the user required to interact with the Manila service
became far simpler and hence, more became more secure with RHOSP 18.
* It is simpler to create a common ceph secret (keyring and ceph config
file) and propagate the secret to all services that need it.

----
$CEPH_SSH cephadm shell
ceph auth caps client.openstack \
  mgr 'allow *' \
  mon 'allow r, profile rbd' \
  osd 'profile rbd pool=vms, profile rbd pool=volumes, profile rbd pool=images, allow rw pool manila_data'
----

== Ceph backend configuration

Create the `ceph-conf-files` secret, containing Ceph configuration:

----
oc apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ceph.client.openstack.keyring: $CEPH_KEY
  ceph.conf: $CEPH_CONF
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-conf-files
  namespace: openstack
type: Opaque
EOF
----

The content of the file should look something like this:

____
[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-conf-files
  namespace: openstack
stringData:
  ceph.client.openstack.keyring: |
    [client.openstack]
        key = <secret key>
        caps mgr = "allow *"
        caps mon = "profile rbd"
        caps osd = "profile rbd pool=images"
  ceph.conf: |
    [global]
    fsid = 7a1719e8-9c59-49e2-ae2b-d7eb08c695d4
    mon_host = 10.1.1.2,10.1.1.3,10.1.1.4
----
____

Configure `extraMounts` within the `OpenStackControlPlane` CR:

----
oc patch openstackcontrolplane openstack --type=merge --patch '
spec:
  extraMounts:
    - name: v1
      region: r1
      extraVol:
        - propagation:
          - CinderVolume
          - CinderBackup
          - GlanceAPI
          - ManilaShare
          extraVolType: Ceph
          volumes:
          - name: ceph
            projected:
              sources:
              - secret:
                  name: ceph-conf-files
          mounts:
          - name: ceph
            mountPath: "/etc/ceph"
            readOnly: true
'

== Getting Ceph FSID

Configuring some OpenStack services to use Ceph backend may require
the FSID value. You can fetch the value from the config like so:

----
CEPH_FSID=$(oc get secret ceph-conf-files -o json | jq -r '.data."ceph.conf"' | base64 -d | grep fsid | sed -e 's/fsid = //')

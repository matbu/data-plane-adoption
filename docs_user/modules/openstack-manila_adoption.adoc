= Adopting the Shared File Systems service

OpenStack Manila is the Shared File Systems service. It provides OpenStack
users with a self-service API to create and manage file shares. File
shares (or simply, "shares"), are built for concurrent read/write access by
any number of clients. This, coupled with the inherent elasticity of the
underlying storage makes the Shared File Systems service essential in
cloud environments with require RWX ("read write many") persistent storage.

== Networking

File shares in OpenStack are accessed directly over a network. Hence, it is
essential to plan the networking of the cloud to create a successful and
sustainable orchestration layer for shared file systems.

Manila supports two levels of storage networking abstractions - one where
users can directly control the networking for their respective file shares;
and another where the storage networking is configured by the OpenStack
administrator. It is important to ensure that the networking in the Red Hat
OpenStack Platform 17.1 matches the network plans for your new cloud after
adoption. This ensures that tenant workloads remain connected to
storage through the adoption process, even as the control plane suffers a
minor interruption. Manila's control plane services are not in the data
path; and shutting down the API, scheduler and share manager services will
not impact access to existing shared file systems.

Typically, storage and storage device management networks are separate.
Manila services only need access to the storage device management network.
For example, if a Ceph cluster was used in the deployment, the "storage"
network refers to the Ceph cluster's public network, and Manila's share
manager service needs to be able to reach it.

== Prerequisites

* Ensure that manila systemd services (api, cron, scheduler) are
stopped. For more information, see xref:stopping-openstack-services_{context}[Stopping OpenStack services].
* Ensure that manila pacemaker services ("openstack-manila-share") are
stopped. For more information, see xref:stopping-openstack-services_{context}[Stopping OpenStack services].
* Ensure that the database migration has completed. For more information, see xref:migrating-databases-to-mariadb-instances_{context}[Migrating databases to MariaDB instances].
* Ensure that OpenShift nodes where `manila-share` service will be deployed
can reach the management network that the storage system is in.
* Ensure that services such as keystone and memcached are available prior to
adopting manila services.
* If tenant-driven networking was enabled (`driver_handles_share_servers=True`),
ensure that neutron has been deployed prior to
adopting manila services.

== Procedure - Manila adoption

=== Copying configuration from the RHOSP 17.1 deployment

Define the `CONTROLLER1_SSH` environment variable, if it link:stop_openstack_services.md#variables[hasn't been
defined] already. Then copy the
configuration file from RHOSP 17.1 for reference.

----
$CONTROLLER1_SSH cat /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/manila/etc/manila/manila.conf | awk '!/^ *#/ && NF' > ~/manila.conf
----

Review this configuration, alongside any configuration changes that were noted
since RHOSP 17.1. Not all of it makes sense to bring into the new cloud
environment:

// - TODO link config diff tables for RHOSP 17.1 (Wallaby) to RHOSP 18 (Antelope) -

* The manila operator is capable of setting up database related configuration
(`[database]`), service authentication (`auth_strategy`,
`[keystone_authtoken]`), message bus configuration
(`transport_url`, `control_exchange`), the default paste config
(`api_paste_config`) and inter-service communication configuration (`
[neutron]`, `[nova]`, `[cinder]`, `[glance]` `[oslo_messaging_*]`). So
all of these can be ignored.
* Ignore the `osapi_share_listen` configuration. In RHOSP 18, you rely on
OpenShift routes and ingress.
* Pay attention to policy overrides. In RHOSP 18, manila ships with a secure
default RBAC, and overrides may not be necessary. Please review RBAC
defaults by using the https://docs.openstack.org/oslo.policy/latest/cli/oslopolicy-policy-generator.html[Oslo policy generator]
tool. If a custom policy is necessary, you must provide it as a
`ConfigMap`. The following sample spec illustrates how a
`ConfigMap` called `manila-policy` can be set up with the contents of a
file called `policy.yaml`.

[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    manila:
      enabled: true
      template:
        manilaAPI:
          customServiceConfig: |
             [oslo_policy]
             policy_file=/etc/manila/policy.yaml
        extraMounts:
        - extraVol:
          - extraVolType: Undefined
            mounts:
            - mountPath: /etc/manila/
              name: policy
              readOnly: true
            propagation:
            - ManilaAPI
            volumes:
            - name: policy
              projected:
                sources:
                - configMap:
                    name: manila-policy
                    items:
                      - key: policy
                        path: policy.yaml
----

* The Manila API service needs the `enabled_share_protocols` option to be
added in the `customServiceConfig` section in `manila: template: manilaAPI`.
* If you had scheduler overrides, add them to the `customServiceConfig`
section in `manila: template: manilaScheduler`.
* If you had multiple storage backend drivers configured with RHOSP 17.1,
you will need to split them up when deploying RHOSP 18. Each storage
backend driver needs to use its own instance of the `manila-share`
service.
* If a storage backend driver needs a custom container image, find it on the
https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search?gs&q=manila[RHOSP Ecosystem Catalog]
and set `manila: template: manilaShares: <custom name> : containerImage`
value. The following example illustrates multiple storage backend drivers,
using custom container images.

----

* If providing sensitive information, such as passwords, hostnames and
usernames, it is recommended to use OpenShift secrets, and the
`customServiceConfigSecrets` key. An example:

----

cat << __EOF__ > ~/netapp_secrets.conf

[netapp]
netapp_server_hostname = 203.0.113.10
netapp_login = fancy_netapp_user
netapp_password = secret_netapp_password
netapp_vserver = mydatavserver
__EOF__

oc create secret generic osp-secret-manila-netapp --from-file=~/netapp_secrets.conf -n openstack
----

* `customConfigSecrets` can be used in any service, the following is a
config example using the secret you created above.

[source,yaml]
----
  spec:
    manila:
      enabled: true
      template:
        < . . . >
        manilaShares:
         netapp:
           customServiceConfig: |
             [DEFAULT]
             debug = true
             enabled_share_backends = netapp
             [netapp]
             driver_handles_share_servers = False
             share_backend_name = netapp
             share_driver = manila.share.drivers.netapp.common.NetAppDriver
             netapp_storage_family = ontap_cluster
             netapp_transport_type = http
           customServiceConfigSecrets:
             - osp-secret-manila-netapp
           replicas: 1
    < . . . >
----

* If you need to present extra files to any of the services, you can use
`extraMounts`. For example, when using ceph, you'd need Manila's ceph
user's keyring file as well as the `ceph.conf` configuration file
available. These are mounted via `extraMounts` as done with the example
below.
* Ensure that the names of the backends (`share_backend_name`) remain as they
did on RHOSP 17.1.
* It is recommended to set the replica count of the `manilaAPI` service and
the `manilaScheduler` service to 3. You should ensure to set the replica
count of the `manilaShares` service/s to 1.
* Ensure that the appropriate storage management network is specified in the
`manilaShares` section. The example below connects the `manilaShares`
instance with the CephFS backend driver to the `storage` network.

=== Verify resources

Test the health of the service:

----
openstack share service list
openstack share pool list --detail
----

Check on existing workloads:

----
openstack share list
openstack share snapshot list
----

You can create further resources:

----
openstack share create cephfs 10 --snapshot mysharesnap --name myshareclone

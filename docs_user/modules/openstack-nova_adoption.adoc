= Adopting the Compute service
____
*NOTE* This example scenario describes a simple single-cell setup. Real
multi-stack topology recommended for production use results in different
cells DBs layout, and should be using different naming schemes (not covered
here this time).
____

== Prerequisites

* Previous Adoption steps completed. Notably,
 ** the xref:mariadb_copy_{context}[Migrating databases to MariaDB instances]
must already be imported into the podified MariaDB;
 ** the xref:keystone_adoption_{context}[Adopting the Identity service] needs to be imported;
 ** the xref:placement_adoption_{context}[Adopting the Placement service] needs to be imported;
 ** the xref:glance_adoption_{context}[Adopting the Image service] needs to be imported;
 ** the xref:ovn_adoption_{context}[Migrating OVN data] need to be imported;
 ** the xref:neutron_adoption_{context}[Adopting the OpenStack Networking service] needs to be imported;
 ** Required services specific topology
 xref:openstack-pull_openstack_configuration.adoc#get-services-topology-specific-configuration[configuration collected];
 ** OpenStack services have been xref:openstack-stop_openstack_services.adoc[stopped]

== Variables

Define the shell variables and aliases used in the steps below. The values are
just illustrative, use values that are correct for your environment:

----
alias openstack="oc exec -t openstackclient -- openstack"
----

== Procedure - Nova adoption

____
*NOTE*: This procedure assumes that Nova Metadata is deployed on the top level and not on each cell level, so this example imports it the same way. If the source deployment has a per cell metadata deployment, adjust the given below patch as needed. Metadata service cannot be run in `cell0`.
____

* Patch OpenStackControlPlane to deploy Nova:
+
[source,yaml]
----
oc patch openstackcontrolplane openstack -n openstack --type=merge --patch '

'
----

* Wait for Nova control plane services' CRs to become ready:
+
----
oc wait --for condition=Ready --timeout=300s Nova/nova
----
+
The local Conductor services will be started for each cell, while the superconductor runs in `cell0`.
Note that `disable_compute_service_check_for_ffu` is mandatory for all imported Nova services, until
the xref:edpm_adoption.adoc[external dataplane imported], and until Nova Compute services fast-forward upgraded.

== Post-checks

* Check that Nova endpoints are defined and pointing to the
podified FQDNs and that Nova API responds.
+
----
openstack endpoint list | grep nova
openstack server list
----

Compare the following outputs with the topology specific configuration
xref:openstack-pull_openstack_configuration.adoc#get-services-topology-specific-configuration[collected earlier]:

* Query the superconductor for cell1 existance and compare it to pre-adoption values:
+
----
echo $PULL_OPENSTACK_CONFIGURATION_NOVAMANAGE_CELL_MAPPINGS
oc rsh nova-cell0-conductor-0 nova-manage cell_v2 list_cells | grep -F '| cell1 |'
----
+
The expected changes to happen:

 ** cell1's `nova` DB and user name become `nova_cell1`.
 ** Default cell is renamed to `cell1` (in a multi-cell setup, it should become indexed as the last cell instead).
 ** RabbitMQ transport URL no longer uses `guest`.
____
*NOTE* At this point, Nova control plane services have yet taken control over
existing Nova compute workloads. That would become possible to verify only after
xref:edpm_adoption_{context}[EDPM adoption] completed.
